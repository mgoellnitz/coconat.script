# CoConAT JavaScript flavour

This is the JavaScript flavour of the [CoConAT Content Access Tool](http://mgoellnitz.github.io/coconat/).
It is a small library to access the contents of a CoreMedia content repository 
through direct access of a Content Server database (CMS, MLS, or RLS) in a 
structured way.

It is a direct translation of the PHP flavour and not in working shape.
